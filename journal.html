              <p>I am now polishing off my final assignment submission of the academic year, this digital portfolio.
                This year has allowed me to become a more professional and industry ready character through these
                professional skills sessions, as they have taught me about working and showcasing my work in a suitable
                way etc. This year has also massively improved my academic skills and preparing me for my next year of
                studies – and this is proven through my software development and web development assignments getting
                first class grades. This year has also expanded my knowledge in a variety of computing sectors from my
                previous qualifications, making me more employable and industry ready. I have also gotten the
                opportunity to maintain the Bridgwater carnival mobile app as my group project and industry placement
                module next year, so over the summer I aim to become proficient in IOS development ready for this
                opportunity. </p>

              <p>I have now submitted all assignment 2’s for my modules this year and am nearing the end of the first
                year of my degree program. These past few weeks have allowed me to develop my skills in planning a
                comprehensive computer network and configuring a simple demo based upon this. I have only had limited
                experience with configuring networks previously, so this assignment provided a valuable learning
                experience, and allowed me to experiment with my research and learning skills learnt from my previous
                academic skills sessions. My data science assignment also allowed me use python libraries for data
                analysis and machine learning on a substantial data set, which I found challenging as this year is the
                only time I have performed any form of data analysis, however I did find this assignment interesting and
                rewarding when experimenting with machine learning models and queries for analysis. </p>

              <h5>8.05.25 - Entry #8</h5>
              <p>Today I have submitted my assignment 2 for cyber security fundamentals, and earlier in the week I
                submitted my software development assignment 2. Both of these assignments were a bit challenging, as the
                cyber security assignment required me to develop a comprehensive cyber security risk assessment and then
                provide suitable mitigation techniques. This allowed me to explore different frameworks used in industry
                to protect and mitigate potential threats and allowed me to experiment and demonstrate the use of
                different tools used to protect networks and end point systems, allowing me to become more proficient
                and experienced in cyber security. The software development assignment required me to use OOP design
                principles to create a program for an estate agent. This was particularly beneficial as it allowed me to
                put my developing OOP skills into practice, allowing me to become a better programmer to make more
                efficient and effective code. </p>

              <p>I have submitted my web application development assignment 2, which I found to be very enjoyable
                putting my skills and knowledge into a real-world scenario for a client. I aimed to complete this
                assignment to a first-class grade standard as web development as a field in computing I would
                potentially like to specialise in. I also received my assignment 2 for software development
                fundamentals. This assignment is a large program for an estate agents that requires me to design,
                develop and evaluate the solution. This assignment might be a struggle due to its large size and
                complexity, so I aim to deepen my knowledge of the C# language by researching potential methods I can
                use to create an effective solution. I also aim to complete this assignment to a first-class standard as
                software development is also an area I would potentially like to specialise in the future, particularly
                for web and mobile development.</p>

              <p>I have completed the first half of the spring term of my degree program. This term has allowed me to
                explore Object-Oriented Programming in more depth to expand my knowledge of using OOP design principles
                like inheritance to create efficient and robust programs in C#. This term has also allowed me to explore
                how machine learning algorithms work and can be used within a dataset to make accurate predictions using
                libraries such as Pandas. I haven’t had much experience with data handling and processing previously so
                this experience will be valuable for my data science assignment 2 and further assignments like full
                stack development next year. This week I also received my assignment 2 for web application development,
                which requires me to design, develop and evaluate a web solution for the Skewer House in Taunton. This
                will allow me to put my web development skills learnt into practice. </p>

                development and principles of data science modules were also presentations, giving me chance to further
                refine my presentation writing and speaking skills. Verbal feedback on my final presentation (principles
                of data science) commended my presentation and delivery skills, which means I feel I have begun to meet
                my target of improving my confidence and clarity in delivering presentations. The web development
                assignment also gave me chance to explore and evaluate tools and frameworks I could use to build
                effective web apps, and expanding my knowledge of web design principles and standards which will
                massively benefit my assignment 2. </p>

                I have also had chance to submit my networking fundamentals assignment. This first report assignment has
                given me chance to apply my academic skills developed during semester 1 into a written report. I have
                massively improved in writing concise and informative work compared to my previous report writing from
                my BTEC, however I still need to improve upon my research finding from truly academic sources. This
                assignment also gave me the opportunity to explore simulating a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. This
                skill will be highly beneficial in future networking tasks such as the network infrastructure management
                module I will complete next year. </p>

                given my first assignments for the networking fundamentals and software development fundamentals
                modules. Both of these assignments were written reports, which allowed me to use my academic skills to
                refine my ability to write concise and detailed reports backed up by reputable sources of information.
                The programming assignment also helped me to deepen my understanding of the C# language by exploring the
                use of new pre-defined functions like RegEx for scanning strings for their characters. This has allowed
                me to write more efficient code for future assignments and future software projects. </p>

                assignment, so this task feels a little unfamiliar and difficult. However, this provides a valuable
                opportunity to build new skills in communication and presentation, as well as putting my improving

                and am learning how to structure content clearly and concisely for a spoken format. I aim to be able to
                confidently deliver clear and professional presentations by the end of the academic year in June as this
                will be a valuable skill for future employment. </p>
